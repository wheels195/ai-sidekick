2. **Chat Interface** - Full-screen chat experience at `/landscaping` route with:
   - Auto-expanding textarea that prevents horizontal scrolling
   - Mobile-optimized touch interactions
   - Full viewport height utilization for better readability
   - Tips and FAQ content positioned below chat for easy access
3. **OpenAI API Integration** - Enhanced AI responses with specialized landscaping prompts focused on digital marketing and local SEO
4. **Component Library** - Full shadcn/ui implementation with custom black theme styling
5. **Mobile Optimization** - Comprehensive mobile-first approach with:
   - Fixed scrolling issues on mobile browsers
   - Touch-friendly interface elements
   - Proper viewport handling for various screen sizes
   - Performance optimizations for mobile devices

## Backend Integration Status

### Completed
- **`/api/chat`** - OpenAI GPT-4o-mini integration with enhanced landscaping system prompts focused on digital marketing, local SEO, and content creation
- **Supabase Integration** - Database schema, authentication, and conversation storage
- **Two-Layer Learning System** - Individual user learning and global pattern recognition
- **Authentication APIs** - Sign up, sign in, sign out, and profile management
- **Conversation Storage** - All chats stored with business context for personalization
- **Privacy Protection** - Row Level Security and anonymized global learning

### Database Schema (Implemented)
- `user_profiles` - Business context and preferences
- `user_conversations` - Chat history with context and metadata
- `uploaded_files` - File storage and analysis results (structure ready)
- `global_conversations` - Anonymized learning system data
- `user_learning` - Individual user preferences and patterns
- `proven_strategies` - Knowledge base of successful strategies
- `user_sessions` - Session tracking and engagement metrics

### API Endpoints (Completed)
- `POST /api/auth/signup` - User registration with business profile
- `POST /api/auth/signin` - User authentication  
- `POST /api/auth/signout` - User logout
- `GET/PUT /api/user/profile` - User profile management

## Development Guidelines

### Styling Conventions
- Use Tailwind CSS classes exclusively
- **Typography**: Inter font loaded via Next.js fonts and configured as default sans-serif
- **Color Scheme**: Black theme with emerald/teal accents (`from-emerald-500 to-teal-500`)
- **Background**: Solid black (`bg-black`) for main sections with gradient overlays for visual interest
- Maintain consistent spacing and responsive breakpoints
- Use backdrop-blur effects for glass morphism with reduced opacity on black backgrounds
- **Mobile Considerations**: Touch-friendly sizing, proper viewport handling, performance optimization

### Component Patterns
- All UI components follow shadcn/ui conventions
- Use Radix UI primitives for accessibility
- Implement proper TypeScript interfaces
- Follow React best practices (hooks, composition)

### Navigation & Routing
- Use Next.js App Router patterns
- Implement smooth scrolling for anchor links
- Handle client-side navigation with `window.location.href`

## Important Notes

- **Production Ready:** âœ… Fully deployed and operational at https://ai-sidekick-alpha.vercel.app
- **Mobile Optimized:** âœ… Comprehensive mobile experience with touch-friendly interactions
- **No Generic Business Logic:** All AI responses must be trade-specific
- **Enhanced AI Prompts:** Focused on digital marketing, local SEO, and content creation strategies
- **Full-Screen Chat:** Chat interface uses full viewport height for optimal user experience
- **File Processing:** Image analysis and document processing capabilities planned
- **Learning System:** Two-layer learning (global + individual user)
