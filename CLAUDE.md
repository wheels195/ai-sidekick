## Development Guidelines

### Styling Conventions
- Use Tailwind CSS classes exclusively
- **Typography**: Inter font loaded via Next.js fonts and configured as default sans-serif
- **Color Scheme**: Black theme with emerald/teal accents (`from-emerald-500 to-teal-500`)
- **Background**: Solid black (`bg-black`) for main sections with gradient overlays for visual interest
- Maintain consistent spacing and responsive breakpoints
- Use backdrop-blur effects for glass morphism with reduced opacity on black backgrounds
- **Mobile Considerations**: Touch-friendly sizing, proper viewport handling, performance optimization

### Component Patterns
- All UI components follow shadcn/ui conventions
- Use Radix UI primitives for accessibility
- Implement proper TypeScript interfaces
- Follow React best practices (hooks, composition)
- **Animation Libraries**: Avoid framer-motion due to React 19 compatibility issues

### Navigation & Routing
- Use Next.js App Router patterns
- Implement smooth scrolling for anchor links
- Handle client-side navigation with `window.location.href`

### Build Compatibility
- Use `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` for React 19 compatibility
- Avoid third-party animation libraries that conflict with React 19
- Test builds locally before deployment to catch dependency conflicts early

## Testing Strategy

No test framework currently implemented. When adding tests:
- Use Jest for unit tests
- Consider Playwright for E2E testing
- Test both frontend components and API endpoints
- Verify file upload/processing workflows
- Test mobile responsiveness and touch interactions

## Analytics & Conversion Tracking

### Analytics API ‚úÖ `/api/admin/analytics`
Real-time conversion tracking for market testing without manual data analysis:

**Key Metrics Tracked:**
- Total conversions and conversion rate (conversions √∑ trial signups)
- Time-based breakdowns (today, week, month)
- User behavior: average tokens used, days to convert
- Revenue projections: plan distribution, projected MRR
- Progress toward 100-conversion goal for payment system validation

**Access Methods:**
```bash
# Development (no auth required)
curl http://localhost:3000/api/admin/analytics

# Production (requires ADMIN_API_KEY)
curl -H "x-admin-key: your-admin-key" https://your-domain.com/api/admin/analytics
```

**Setup Requirements:**
1. Run SQL script: `/sql/create_upgrade_conversions_table.sql` in Supabase
2. Set `ADMIN_API_KEY` environment variable for production security
3. Monitor `/api/admin/analytics` endpoint for real-time conversion data

**Market Testing Workflow:**
1. Monitor conversion rate from trial to paid plans
2. Track time-to-convert and token utilization patterns  
3. Reach 100 conversions before implementing payment processing
4. Use data to optimize upgrade flow and pricing strategy
