## Development Guidelines

### Styling Conventions
- Use Tailwind CSS classes exclusively
- **Typography**: Inter font loaded via Next.js fonts and configured as default sans-serif
- **Color Scheme**: Black theme with emerald/teal accents (`from-emerald-500 to-teal-500`)
- **Background**: Solid black (`bg-black`) for main sections with gradient overlays for visual interest
- Maintain consistent spacing and responsive breakpoints
- Use backdrop-blur effects for glass morphism with reduced opacity on black backgrounds
- **Mobile Considerations**: Touch-friendly sizing, proper viewport handling, performance optimization

### Component Patterns
- All UI components follow shadcn/ui conventions
- Use Radix UI primitives for accessibility
- Implement proper TypeScript interfaces
- Follow React best practices (hooks, composition)

### Navigation & Routing
- Use Next.js App Router patterns
- Implement smooth scrolling for anchor links
- Handle client-side navigation with `window.location.href`
