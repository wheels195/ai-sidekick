# AI Sidekick - Specialized AI for Local Trades

## Project Overview

AI Sidekick is an intelligent assistant platform designed specifically for local trade businesses. Unlike generic AI tools, each AI sidekick is trained exclusively on industry-specific knowledge, challenges, and best practices to provide expert guidance that actually works for real businesses.

**Current Focus:** Landscaping businesses (first vertical)

## The Problem We're Solving

Local trade businesses struggle with:
- Generic marketing advice that doesn't work for their industry
- Expensive consultants ($200+/hour) for basic business questions
- Time wasted researching strategies instead of working
- Lack of industry-specific guidance for growth

## Our Solution

**Industry-Specific AI Sidekicks** that provide:
- 24/7 expert advice tailored to their exact trade
- Local SEO strategies that actually work
- Seasonal business planning and content ideas
- Upselling strategies and pricing guidance
- Customer retention and review management
- Content generation for websites and social media

## Unique Technology: Two-Layer Learning System

### Layer 1: Global Knowledge Base
- All conversations across users (anonymized)
